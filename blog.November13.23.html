                    <h2>November 13</h2>
                    <p><span>For the first part of the day, I want to finish the assignment for the Political Science class. I&apos;m so reluctant to do that, but hopefully, It won&apos;t take long to write, and I will be left with plenty of time to finish yesterday&apos;s code.</span></p>
                    <p><span>I feel like I&apos;m wasting time reading about this stuff, to make matters worse, someone who sat beside me, said that it&apos;s useless to improve writing skills as an engineer. I have mixed feelings about this, as a non-native person, my level of literacy for English is akin to high schooler or even worse, so naturally, I want to improve on that. But, we have finite time and we need to choose carefully what to spend time improving on. So, the question is whether it&apos;s more important than doing what I&apos;ve done yesterday, for example. On the other hand, people naturally tend to dismiss bad-expressed ideas with a person who expressed this idea to add on and everything he will say afterward. I think writing skills are worth pursuing for 5% of my monthly effort(this blog should suffice).</span></p>
                    
                    <p><span>I don&apos;t know how to not be awkward when speaking with someone. Usage of slang doesn&apos;t come naturally to me. It might be reasonable to assume that some part of it comes due to my terrible English, but it was actually the same when I was speaking in my native language, back in my home country. I wonder why it takes me longer to get closer to a person compared to others. The only person with whom I could talk without restraint was my friend from my home country, but it took me 2 years to reach the level where I could speak with him casually without thinking what should I say afterward.</span></p>
                    
                    <p><span>I also got WHIMIS tests to be able to do something in the shop. Shop orientation will be held tomorrow and afterward, I&apos;ll be able to attend different workshops on machining, etc..</span></p>
                    
                    <p><span>The US Electoral College is the most confusing system EVER. I bet if they made the process easier they would&apos;ve increased the turn-out rate by a high margin. Even Chatgpt is confused with the two-meaning word &quot;electorate&quot;. It&apos;s 3 pm and I&apos;m not even 1/5th done with this essay.</span></p>
                    
                    <p><span>People track something that they care about and want to improve on. I believe to control one&apos;s time, it&apos;s necessary to track it, up to the minute. But, as with everything of that sort, it&apos;s a very mundane activity and usually people don&apos;t see its benefits when everything is going well. That is the case for me as well. I used track time and gave up on it for 5 times this year. And, usually, It wasn&apos;t longer than a week for me to lose motivation or to just forget to do it. I&apos;ll give it another try starting from now on.</span></p>
                    
                    <p><span>I wonder when one can be sure that his idea is novel. There are too many people in the world to say that something is novel.</span></p>
                    
                    <p><span>6 pm: I&apos;m half finished but I want to quit. I&apos;ll go buy some cookies with milk and give myself a little rest. (I&apos;m weak, sorry)</span></p>
                    
                    <p><span>Fast forward to 10 pm, I didn&apos;t finish this paper, and that WHIMIS test completely went out of my head. But, It&apos;s already 10 pm and I don&apos;t want to jeopardize my beloved 7 am regime just to do some work with my messed up foggy brain.</span></p>
                    
                    <p><span>To conclude:</span></p>
                    <p><span>This day was shit. 3/10.</span></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span>Bring some snacks to the library beside the meal.</span></li>
                        <li><span>You can safely assume that you won&apos;t do any work at home or after taking hour long break.</span></li>
                        <li><span>Track your time</span></li>
                    </ul>
